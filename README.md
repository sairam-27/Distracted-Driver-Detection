This is a very simple evaluation of the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset on pretrained CNN models like VGG-16, DenseNet and ResNet

How to use:

1. Download the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset frome [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data)
2. Run any of the files of VGG-16, DenseNet or ResNet
3. A preprocessed image folder(modified\train) would be generated with train and test folders habing a 80-20 split of each class <img width="774" height="361" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce21c26c-b302-4a2d-baf5-a619339a7205" />
